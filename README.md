## Get Your Pi Online
### Pictures

### Lesson
This assignment I had a very difficult time trying to troubleshoot to get my Pi online. After thoroughly reviewing my code, I found a tiny error causing my code not to work. There was a space between an = and a letter, which is what caused the problem. After fixing that I was able to get it online. 

## Dice Roller

### Lesson.
This assignment I coded the Pi to roll a dice on its own. How it works is you press enter and a random number is then displayed on the screen ranging 1 through 6, just like dice. I had a problem trying to figure out how to run the code. I then figured out you needed to type Python3 to run code in the nano.  

## Calculator

### Lesson
This assignment I made a calculator that finds the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder. How it works is you enter 2 numbers and it takes them and adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides them by each other, then displays the values on the screen. I had trouble getting my if statement to work and I realized it was because of a small mistake using one = instead of two. 

## Quadratic Solver

### Lesson
This assignment I created a program to solve a quadratic equation, given the roots or stating that there is none. How it works is you enter three values and the solver takes them and finds the roots between them. If there are none it says no real roots. I had trouble figuring out how to make an array, but after browsing the web and talking to friends I figured it out. 

## Strings and Loops

### Lesson
This assignment uses arrays to display words you type out, spaced out line by line. How it works is you type a sentence, and the Pi takes it and spaces each letter out on each line, with a dash indicating spaces. I had trouble figuring out how to make them split between lines but I figured it out using a split function.
